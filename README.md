# Life Expectancy and GDP Starter - Data Analysis project

The project has been made in the scope of my training at Codecademy.com.
*Data source: World Health Organization and the World Bank*

## Objectives

WHO and World Bank provides data on the GDP and Life Expectancy for countries all over the world and we had a look to the evolution of these two indicators between 2005 and 2015 within 6 countries: USA, Germany, China, Mexico, Chile and Zimbabwe.

This project is meant for me to get more familiar with data analysis tools and data vizualisation with Python.

## Launch

Find the code and explainations in the jupyter notebook file: [life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb](https://github.com/jossbnd/codecademy_Life_Expectancy_and_GDP_Starter/blob/main/life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb)

In addition, find my article posted on medium.com: [link](https://medium.com/@joss.b/gdp-and-life-expectancy-between-2000-and-2015-847614f62325)  
This was part of the training as well.
